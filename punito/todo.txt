- Improve planner, tester etc. prompts to dynamically provide example for code and plan.
- create agent which will go through all class and then send a configuration for further prompts: what examples to use or what prompts/steps
  in pipeline to call further.
- Improve PanelControllerExampleMockitoTest.java
- Improve planner - it should only write plans for tested function, not taking into consideration state changes in execution function
  (test with exectuion  fn: initializePanle, tested fn: hide...)
- Remember to instruct in documentation in confluence for punito to go to windows registry editor -> HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem
  and set LongPathsEnabled to 1
- use request rather than streaming
- refactor preprocessor
- add tests
- instead of one big example for test give smaller precise ones for certain things

- REMOVE reviewer
